 Implemented a robust backup strategy for Jenkins using AWS S3 and developed an automated Bash script for nightly backups of the Jenkins home directory, scheduled with a cronjob. This ensured secure, offsite storage and compliance with data retention policies, achieving 99.9% data durability and enabling rapid recovery from hardware failures, which decreased downtime by 30% during critical incidents.

Designed and implemented a high-availability Jenkins architecture using a master-worker approach, which enabled dynamic load balancing across multiple build agents. This strategy improved build efficiency by 40% and reduced build times by 50% during peak hours, facilitating faster feedback for developers and significantly enhancing overall team productivity. Additionally, this architecture minimized the risk of bottlenecks, ensuring consistent and reliable CI/CD processes even under heavy workloads.
